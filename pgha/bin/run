# pgha - PostgreSQL High Availability Monitor
#
# NOTES:
# - Be sure that etcdctl is available and etcd is running.
# - This script runs under the postgresql user as a minutely cronjob:
#
#    * * * * * /opt/sm/bin/sm pgha run
#
# - To run manually in debug mode as user postgres:
# 
#   DEBUG=1 pgdata=/var/db/postgresql/9.3/data sm pgha run
#
# TODO: 
# - vmotion master comes back online safely.
# - multiple failures including both master and sync.
#
# Questions:
#  - Should we save the original master_ip when sync is promoted?  Not unless we want to report back 
#    to some central authority that the server pool lost a server
#
# Keep track of where we go next.
#
# TODO: Remove pgdata once everything is configured via etcd.
